Hello,

In this recipes project, I am going to make a basic brutalist website for a few recipes.

I am following The Odin Project's Foundations Course for this.

By finishing this project, I will have demonstrated that I can do some html stuff, and hopefully some css stuff.

Sky's the limit, you know?

Thanks for reading,
William Z Chadwick
