                <h3>As described (loosely) to me by a brother of a close friend.</h3>
		<br>
		<p>I still remember the delicious smell in that stuffy kitchen,</p>
		<p>southwest Missouri in a house filled with books and cats,</p>
		<p>my friend's brother nonchalantly told me how to make this.</p>
		<p>In the next year or two, in the Rockies,</p>
		<p>I made this with my syblings and grandma for a reunion.</p>
		<br>
		<h2>Ingredients</h2>

					<li>Notes:</li>
                                	<li>This food takes a surprisngly long time to make, and you get your hands dirty, but it feels wonderful, and kind of fancy</li>
                                	<li>Make sure you buy a lot of shrimp if more than 1 person will be eating it; it goes quick</li>
                                	<li>You should cook this with others, it's fun - and you can be flexible about the sauce you choose</li>
				</ul>
				<li>Enjoy!</li>
                        </ol>
