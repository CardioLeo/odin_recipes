		<h3>This was my grandfather's recipe, and it is also a family favorite</h3>
		<p>(miss you, Grandpa)</p>
                <br>
		<p>This has always been a holiday favorite-</p>
		<p>and sometimes just a very special treat.</p>
		<p>My grandfather made this, and my dad, too,</p>
		<p>and so rarely did I ever even have other fudges</p>
		<p>that it really didn't occur to me for a long time</p>
		<p>that most people don't call peanut butter fudge</p>
		<p>simply fudge.</p>
